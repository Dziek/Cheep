Unsure what the last event will be, 
but I imagine the camera is wide for a big finish. 
The camera should slowly zoom back to the player, 
who is hopefully cheeping away.
The credits will start mid cheep, 
playing some music, with the cheeps faintly audible in the background 
getting louder as the credits go on
Unsure what the Epilogue is. There should be a way to restart I guess?
